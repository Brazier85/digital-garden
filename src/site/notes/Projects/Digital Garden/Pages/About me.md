## Daily work

In my day-to-day job, I am a tech lead for a small team of IT-Administrators. We do take care of the ot-server infrastructure worldwide for our company ([SICK AG](https://sick.com/)). Sadly I can not write a lot more about the company here because of our work NDAs.

## Free time

In my free time, I do voluntary work for the Red Cross in Germany, play with my children, and tinker around with my 3D printer and a lot of other tech/it-related stuff.
